# Ping Pong Game in NASM

## About
A simple Ping Pong game implemented in NASM assembly language for the EE2003 – Computer Organization and Assembly Language course. This game allows two players to control paddles and try to prevent the ball from crossing their side of the screen. The game keeps track of the score and declares the winner when a player reaches a predefined score.

## Introduction
This project is developed as part of the **EE2003 – Computer Organization and Assembly Language** course at **National University Computer & Emerging Sciences – Chiniot FSD Campus**. The aim of the project is to demonstrate assembly programming skills by implementing a simple yet engaging Ping Pong game using **NASM assembly language**. The game works in a **DOSBox** emulator and involves two players controlling paddles to prevent the ball from crossing their side, with scoring and a win condition implemented.

## Requirements
- **Assembler:** NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- **Emulator:** DOSBox (for running 8086 assembly code)

## How to Run
1. Set up your development environment with **NASM** and **DOSBox**.
2. Assemble the `.asm` file using NASM to create a `.COM` or `.EXE` file.
3. Run the file in **DOSBox** to play the game.

## Controls
- **Player 1:** Use 'W' to move up and 'S' to move down.
- **Player 2:** Use the Up and Down arrow keys to control the paddle.
- **Pause/Resume:** Press 'P'.
- **Restart Game:** After a win, press any key to restart or 'ESC' to exit.

## Future Improvements
- Improved collision detection and smoother gameplay.
- Additional sound effects and advanced graphics.
- Difficulty settings and game modes.
